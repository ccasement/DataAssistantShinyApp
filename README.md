## Description

The `DataAssistant` `R` Shiny app enables users to randomly generate
data, make new versions of existing data through common adjustments
(e.g., adding random normal noise and performing transformations), and
check the suitability of the resulting data for statistical analyses.
The app was designed to support educators in wide-ranging disciplines,
with a particular focus on those teaching introductory statistical
methods (descriptive and/or inferential) for data analysis.

`DataAssistant` is also available as an `R` package, and is available to
download from
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">CRAN</a>.
